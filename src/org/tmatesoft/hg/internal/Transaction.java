/**
 * Implementation strategies possible:<ul>
 * <li> Get a copy, write changes to origin, keep copy as backup till #commit
 *   <p>(-) doesn't break hard links 
 * <li> Get a copy, write changes to a copy, on commit rename copy to origin. 
 *   <p>(-) What if we read newly written data (won't find it);
 *   <p>(-) complex #commit
 *   <p>(+) simple rollback
 * <li> Get a copy, rename origin to backup (breaks hard links), rename copy to origin, write changes 
 *   <p>(+) Modified file is in place right away;
 *   <p>(+) easy #commit
 * <li> Do not copy, just record file size, truncate to that size on rollback
 * <li> ...?
