/**
 * Checked exception that client supplied callback code can use to indicates its own errors.
 * 
 * <p>Generally, client need to pass own error information/exceptions from within implementations of the callback methods they supply. 
 * However, there's no straightforward way to alter throws clause for these methods, and alternatives like generic {@link Exception} or
 * library's own {@link HgException} are rather obscure. Suggested approach is to wrap whatever exception user code produces with
 * {@link HgCallbackTargetException}, the only checked exception allowed out from a callback.
 * 
 * <p>It's intentionally not a subclass of {@link HgException} to avoid get mixed with library own errors and be processed separately.
 * 
 * <p>Top-level API handlers ({@link HgStatusHandler}, {@link HgManifestHandler}, {@link HgChangesetHandler}, etc) allow to throw 
 * HgCallbackTargetException from their methods. Exceptions thrown this way are not handled in corresponding commands, except for
 * revision or file name specification, unless already set. Then, these exceptions go straight to the command caller.
